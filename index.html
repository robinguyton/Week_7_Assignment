<h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>

<p>Showing up to class and being able to ask questions is what usually helped me understand the material. When class was canceled due to holidays or other things, I'd utilize Youtube to help me better understand things I was having trouble with.</p>

<h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>

<p>Some of the other students seemed to be disruptive or slow down the process. Sometimes they would ask questions about things that weren't even part of the topic that day, or things that could've been asked after class or before class. I found that to be extremely annoying, but I guess the place to ask questions IS in the classroom, they could've just picked a better time for off-topic discussions (but it also doesn't help that lots of students spent class time having side discussions, so it wasn't surprising that they weren't catching on with what was going on).</p>

<h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>

<p>I wasn't expecting most of the grids to be part of the course and it definitely took some getting used to! But I did eventually get it down well with a bit of trial and error!</p>

<h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>

<p>As I mentioned before, the grids were completely out of left field for me. I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS, while Boostrap was entirely new to me.</p>
